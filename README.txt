3rd milestone: This assignment is [95]% complete. 
(-5%): We haven't finished the deleting timeline function on the front end of our app. But we have 
completed the server with fully support for delete and edit function.
On a side note, we completed all the functions for user editing infomation and CRUD for admin dashboard function. 
We successfully populated the information of users on the page with username, email and profile picture.
We also included a lot of Easter Eggs in many pages, both admin and user. We hope you have great time enjoying our mystery :D
